    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello I'm Suraj.</p>
    <p>
      Professionally I'm a product manager and my current focus is on <a href="https://www.refinitiv.com/">making it easier for people to make decisions using data and content</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a person I'm happiest working in teams looking to solve large problems. These can be for people, organisations or even machines. Overall I aim to create the best outcomes combining design, technology and data.
