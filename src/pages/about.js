    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello I'm Suraj.</p>
    <p>
      Professionally I'm a product manager and my current focus is on <a href="https://humanisingautonomy.com/">building easy interfaces for human and machine interaction using computer vision</a>.
    </p>
    <p>I am a trustee and board member for the <a href="https://integratedtransport.org.uk/">Foundation for Integrated Transport</a>, through which I support grant making and impact investment into sustainable and transformational transport solutions.</p>
    <p>As a person I'm happiest working in teams looking to solve large problems. These can be for people, organisations or even machines. Overall I aim to create the best outcomes combining design, technology and data.</p>
    <p>You may like to explore my <a href="/projects">projects</a> or some of my <a href="/journal">thinking and writing</a>, sign up to my occasional <a href="/newsletter">newsletter</a>. Or sign my <a href="/guestbook">guestbook</a>?</p>
    <h4>Shall we collaborate on something?</h4>
    <p>
      I'm always open for talking through ideas, problems and more. Feel free to send me a message using <a href="/contact">my contact details</a>.
