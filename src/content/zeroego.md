> TL;DR: Embrace humility, collaborate openly and focus on the outcomes to work effectively with zero ego.

Ego's often simply gets in the way of doing your best work. Maybe this comes a feeling that our job title means we should be arbiters of how things should be done. Or perhaps it's just the way a message was conveyed. This nagging threat to our self could be real, of course the details matter and are important to get right, but it's worth pausing to ask _Is this about making a real contribution, or is ego controlling the response?_. 

Working with zero ego isn’t about diminishing yourself. In my opinion it's about working to achieve the best outcome, at that moment. Three perspectives from me to support operating effectively without ego, to work smarter:

### 1. Embrace Humility
We don't know everything and that’s okay. Owning what you don’t know creates space to learn from others. It’s never about being the cleverest mind in the room. 

So ask questions even if you think it's the dumb ones. The answers open you up to learning from others, it offers you an opportunity to check if you have shared understanding and finally allows a means to self correct both sides. 

 > Tip: When asking questions, come prepared, a quick set of notes or a doc list. It shows you have thought about the problem space and often motivates others to answer empathetically.

 Note when you do ask questions try to avoid the [XY Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem#Examples).

### 2. Collaborate Openly
Share your ideas freely and be just as quick to praise others’ contributions. Collaboration isn’t a competition or a race to outshine anyone. In my opinion it's about pooling strengths to achieve something greater together.

Now when you've started that collaboration really listen. Engage with what they’re saying, asking questions, and showing you value their input. This builds trust and fosters better communication and remember point 1. 

> Tip: Share your thoughts into a _thread_ on a group chat or Slack channel like, “Hey thinking of approaching X problem like this" if you're at all interested in this do share your thoughts in the thread.” It’s a simple action that gives asynchronous opportunity for everyone to be looped in, and can offer up better ideas than ones you might create solo.

### 3. Focus on the Outcome
Keep your sights on the end goal. Often in discussions and working through points 1 and 2 it's important to know _What’s the ultimate objective?_ _What are we aiming for?_. Let those questions guide your choices and cut through the noise. When the focus shifts from personal wins to a longer term shared success, the results will feel more meaningful.

The bonus here is that even if you get to a slightly incorrect solution you'll have built up the cultural muscle to loop through this all again.

> Tip: Slap a sticky note with the big goal on your desk. Or set your laptop background with the goals of the quarter / mission in mind. It’s an easy way to stay grounded and aligned to what you're trying to achieve.

Operating with zero ego takes a little practice, but the rewards are great: happier work, stronger culture, and better outcomes.
