###Experience over features


Now, honestly this might be one of the most boring things but take a moment to consider if you wanted to close this page. Did you know pressing `Command + W` would do that for you?

Knowing that might just save you ~1 second of your life, which could eventually accumulate to maybe whole week given back to you?

Here are some of my favourites:

| Function                 | Keys                | Thoughts                                                                            |
|:-------------------------|:--------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Close tab                | Command + W         | I'm a tab hoarder, when it gets too much closing them down quickly is super helpful |
| Reopen closed tab        | Command + Shift + T | Sometimes however I get it wrong and this helps me reopen something I've closed.    |
| Focus on the address Bar | Command + L         | Avoids finding, moving and then clicking your mouse. Lots of little time saved.     |
| Open your history        | Command + Y         | Quickly find the the thing you were previously looking at.                          |

Hopefully these will save you little bit of time to do greater and better things.

If you have any more great shortcuts do let me know, I'm all ears.
