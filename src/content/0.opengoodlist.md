#### A living set of internet bookmarks that are somewhat good.

This is my open list of links to some *good* things on the internet.

They cover a variety of themes and topics. Some might be useful for you, others are purely entertaining.

Feel free to explore or make use of the data.

If you have any more great links do [let me know](/contact).
