A team of movers helped transport our belongings recently. Seeing how they worked incredibly _effectively_ made reflect on how good teams operate.

A few perspectives:

#### Create a shared understanding of the situation

What's in the room to where it's going. Having the same understanding that everyone can work from is a crucial starting point. Good teams are aligned on the operating context.

#### Know who is doing what and how that helps

Packing, transporting, resupplying materials etc, what role does everyone play and how is it contributing to the end goal. Good teams are aware of each other's responsibilities.

#### Check in with each other continuously and offer to help

Check on the overall progress, if one part is done, help elsewhere but ask first. Good teams communicate regularly, clearly and support each other where they can.

#### Break big tasks into smaller milestones

Complete these rooms first, break, reassess and continue. Good teams split large efforts with moments of introspection.

#### Trust each other to get things done

An earlier finish is good for everyone. Good teams have aligned incentives and high levels of trust.
