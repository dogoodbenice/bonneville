## An open offer to help

This is an open invitation: if you've visited here and think I can help you in someway, I **want** to talk to you.

My email addresses is "this is suraj rai @ gmail . com".

In particular I might be able to help with:

* Open mentoring, coaching and or thinking sessions
* Identifying pain points in your product
* Collaborating on mapping and designing the right solutions
* Balancing parenthood with work
* Thinking about scaling your business and growth

If you would like a bio:
> I am an experienced product leader with a variety of experiences to draw on. From biotechnology, to technology consultancy, to AI product development I’m here to help in anyway I can. If I can’t help then I’m very likely to know someone who might. 
>
> Combining strong technical foundation with a pragmatic approach, I can help in navigating complexities of making things with hands on guidance.

I’d be delighted to help in anyway so please do [get in touch](/contact). Alternatively if you're not quite ready sign up to my letters to stay in [touch](/newsletter) or leave me a note on the [guestbook](/guestbook).
