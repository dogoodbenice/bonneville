I've been continually adding and updating [my open good link list](/open-good-list). This is my open list of links for things, that I see, are *good* on the internet.

A few new data point additions beyond purely links:

**Themes**
_Data on the type of link._
I've found that grouping links is useful for filtering and contextualising. I've settled on the below and they are applied together as tag combinations:

- AI: Relating to Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and related tech.
- Advice: Any tips, tricks, and guidance on a variety of topics.
- Art: Creative things, including visual arts, music, literature and quite often generative.
- Code: Programming, repositories, code snippets, and other development tools.
- Cool: Interesting, innovative, or unique ideas and trends.
- Content: Articles, blog posts, and other content.
- Data: Raw data or relating to data science, data analysis and or data visualization.
- Design: All things relating to crafting better physical, graphic, UX, life and or web experiences.
- Education: Learning resources, tutorials, and courses.
- Entrepreneurship: Relating to starting and running a business.
- Fun: Random, whimsical, entertaining, games, and hobbies.
- Good Enterprise: Ethical and socially responsible business practices.
- Health: Wellness, fitness, and mental health.
- Jobs: Job listings and career advice.
- Product: These are products in some form.
- Product Management: Items relating to the profession and discipline of creating products.
- Tool: Useful software, apps and online tools.
- Useful: Generally Practical and helpful resources.

**Last visited**
_The last date I visited this link._
As the list grows I've found it's useful to know and filter by their last visit date to:

- Help refine away any link rot
- Revisit older items
- See some trends in what was visited

**Similar to**
_Other links that relate in some manner._
As the list grows similarities emerge and it's useful to be able to be able to find _something_ to the topic. These might be alternative takes or iterations building on the initial idea or even similar links relating to the way the link has been produced. This is currently the most sparse data point.

#### Please feel free to explore or make use of the links.
