#### An observation into my go to sounds for personal productivity

I've noticed that I use a set of playlists and websites as an accompaniment to doing things and being generally productive.

I suspect these might specifically only work for me, but you may also find them useful.

#### General focus
Some nice repetitive loops that help in most tasks.

#### Activities that need to happen fast, when in flow
It's Irish folk music. A note that some of these can be somewhat peculiar but they just work for me.

Something about the melodies and beats per minute perhaps.

#### Thinking and ideating
Most of the forest sounds here come with white noise along side lovely natural sounds.
It works well for me when needing to reflect.

If you have any sounds conducive to productivity, do [let me know](/contact) I'm all ears.
