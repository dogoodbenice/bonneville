#### A quick framework that might help you to help others ask questions.

It's 2:23pm in the working day, you're wrapping up your presentation and now are opening the floor to questions. You do so perhaps by saying, does anyone have any questions? The room or call responds with silence.

#### Why does no one ask questions and why does it matter?
There could be a number of reasons that this happens. A couple of options:
- Everyone got everything.
  - Positive, you did a great job.
- People are afraid to ask questions
  - Negative, there are questions but people don't have the confidence to raise them.
- People aren't interested or didn't understand.
  - Negative, they may have questions
- People don't know what to ask
  - Negative,

This matters
