#### A quick framework that might help you to help others ask questions.

It's 2:23pm in the working day, you're wrapping up your presentation and now are opening the floor to questions. You do so perhaps by saying, any questions? The room or call responds with blanks overall.

#### Why does no one ask questions?

>The problem is that once we know something—say, the melody of a song—we find it hard to imagine not knowing it. Our knowledge has “cursed” us.
